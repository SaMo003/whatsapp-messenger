# whatsapp-messenger

This Python mini project utilises the Pywhatkit module to send WhatsApp messages using Python. The 'sendwhatmsg' function takes 4 parameters - the receiver's phone number along with its country code, the message to be sent, hours, minutes. These 4 parameters let the function know what message to send to whom and at what time.
